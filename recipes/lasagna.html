    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat</strong>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground
        beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the
        meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato
        sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the
        flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley,
        dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra
        decadent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg</strong>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna
        when you cut into it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a 16 quart pot combine the tripe and the onions.</li>
      <li>
        Add water until pot is about 3/4 full. Cover and cook on low heat for about 2 hours, or
        until the tripe is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the hominy, chili powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook for another 45
        minutes to one hour to incorporate the flavors.
      </li>
